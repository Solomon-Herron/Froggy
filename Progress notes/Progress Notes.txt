Each of these notes need to go in commit note

08/29/2020:
-created boilerplate, all classes and jsps.
-created Pojos for Bug and User
--***On paper: notes8_29.jpg **
--Described the responsibilities and capabilities of a User and Admin(not on paper yet, admins simply have CRUD capabilities for users)
--Scribbled program UI flowchart
--Scribbled some really fugly psuedocode as to how past bug descriptions will be appended to change history

--finished backend objects, began constructing jsp pages. **Currently facing an error: 'java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot forward after response has been committed' when trying to submit new user data from

 Their passwords were never/are not hashed, so they fail BCrypt password verification.

 The issue with the illegalstateexception may lie in the fact that data has already been appended to request before sending it to userDAO.listUsers(). More research needed..

       You add a log statement before and after a section of code that you think is not behaving properly. The first log should print the inputs, the second should print the status
       of the outputs. Run it and see if the result is what you expect. If not, move the output log line closer to the input and test again. Eventually you'll find which lines are
